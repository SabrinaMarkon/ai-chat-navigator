Avoid 'any' type - use 'unknown' instead\n4. Leverage union types and type guards\n5. Use const assertions for literal types\n6. Organize types in separate .d.ts files\n7. Use generics for reusable components\n8. Enable consistent import sorting",

Here's the difference:\n\n**Use Interfaces when:**\n- Defining object shapes\n- You need declaration merging\n- Building public APIs\n- Working with classes\n\n**Use Types when:**\n- Creating union types (type A = B | C)\n- Creating intersection types\n- Working with primitives or tuples\n- Using mapped types\n\nRule of thumb: Default to interfaces for objects, use types for everything else.",
